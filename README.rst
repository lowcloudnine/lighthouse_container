Overview
--------

An OCI compliant image available on
`docker hub <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lowcloudnine/lighthouse>`_ to run
Google Lighthouse tests against a given URL.  It can be used to generate a single score or output
the HTML file.  The goal is to provide a tool that can be used in CI/CD pipelines to ensure any
front-end product achieves a given level and doesn't regress.
